# Solar-Energy-Production

## Use Case Scenario:

A renewable energy company wants to identify potential areas suitable for solar power generation in a specific region. They want to know which areas have the most potential for solar energy generation based on various factors such as terrain, solar irradiance, and land use. The company wants to make an informed decision on where to invest their resources to install solar power plants.

## Problem to be solved:

What are the areas in the region that have the most potential for solar energy generation based on terrain, solar irradiance, and land use?

## Necessary datasets:

Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of the region
Land use data of the region
Solar irradiance data of the region
Data set details:
[1] Name
[2] Area
[3] Solar Mean

## Client application details:

A client application will be developed using the Leaflet framework to connect to the GeoServer instance and visualize the data. The client application will allow the renewable energy company to select the region of interest and view the areas suitable for solar power energy generation based on various factors such as terrain, solar irradiance, and land use. The client application will display the potential areas on a map and allow the user to interact with the data to make informed decisions.
