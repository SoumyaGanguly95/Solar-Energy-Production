# Solar-Energy-Production

## Use Case Scenario:

A renewable energy company wants to identify potential areas suitable for solar power generation in a specific region. They want to know which areas have the most potential for solar energy generation based on various factors such as terrain, solar irradiance, and land use. The company wants to make an informed decision on where to invest their resources to install solar power plants.

## Problem to be solved:

What are the areas in the region that have the most potential for solar energy generation based on terrain, solar irradiance, and land use?

## Necessary datasets:

Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of the region
Land use data of the region
Solar irradiance data of the region
Data set details:

Content of the dataset: A dataset containing information on the areas suitable for solar power energy generation in a specific region.
Approach to store and manage data: The data will be stored in a database management system. The database management system will be used to store and manage the DEM, land use data, and solar irradiance data.
Structure of the dataset: The dataset will contain the following information for each area:
Area name/ID
Terrain information (slope, aspect, elevation)
Land use information (e.g. agricultural, forest, urban)
Solar irradiance information (e.g. annual average solar irradiance, direct normal irradiance, diffuse horizontal irradiance)
Potential for solar power energy generation (e.g. high, medium, low)
Suitable encoding for the data: The data will be encoded in JSON format.
Generating the content of the dataset: The data will be generated using synthetic data based on the characteristics of the region.
Setting up a data access service for the data: The data access service will be set up using a GeoServer instance on a local computer. The data will be imported into the GeoServer instance using ETL tools.
Importing the dataset into the data access service: The dataset will be imported into the GeoServer instance using ETL tools.

## Client application details:

A client application will be developed using the Leaflet framework to connect to the GeoServer instance and visualize the data. The client application will allow the renewable energy company to select the region of interest and view the areas suitable for solar power energy generation based on various factors such as terrain, solar irradiance, and land use. The client application will display the potential areas on a map and allow the user to interact with the data to make informed decisions.
